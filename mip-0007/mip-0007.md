## Abstract

Post real-time gigs like taxi and food delivery.
Allow purchasers to search and connect with workers.

## Motivation

Apps connecting people for "gigs" have become very popular.
Uber paved the way, turning everyone into on-demand taxis.
Other services like food delivery, handy-man, and more have also taken off.
These are closed systems and users are at the whim of the centralized networks that control them.
Using Memo to post gigs will enable a global decentralized peer-to-peer gig economy.
